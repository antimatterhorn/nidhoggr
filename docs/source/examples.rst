Examples
========

The ``examples`` folder holds Python runscripts that each solve a particular physics or math problem.

cherenkov.py
-----------------
Simulates a supersonic (or superluminal) point source moving through a medium at a speed greater than c.

plinko.py
-----------------
Simulates the Plinko game.

rps.py
-----------------
Simulates the destruction of chemical mixtures in a rock-paper-scissors-like reaction setup, where A->B->C->A. In this case,
A is blue, B is green, and C is red.

tsunami.py
-----------------
Simulates a tsunami generated by a point source off the San Francisco Bay.

waveLogo.py
-----------------
Simulates acoustic waves inside a region with Dirichlet boundary conditions arranged in a unique fashion.

Simple Test Cases
-----------------

Many of the Python scripts inside the ``tests`` folder stress single components of Nidhoggr, or a small subset of them. For instance, 
``waveBox.py`` tests the acoustic wave solver with a single oscillatory source in the center of a box with two openings on either end 
(using Dirichlet boundaries to create the box).
